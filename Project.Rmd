# Introduction

Trauma is defined as a physical injury of external origin together with
the body's associated response. This phenomenon constitutes 9% of global
deaths annually [@world2014injuries]. Trauma affects lower and middle
income countries to a greater degree. Furthermore, young people are at
higher risk for trauma compared to the general population. It is the
leading cause of death for individuals between the ages 10 to
49[@vos2020global];[@roth2018global]. The most common type of trauma
among individuals of all ages are road traffic injuries
[@vos2020global];[@roth2018global]. In Sweden, road traffic injuries
account for around 40% of injuries and falls account for 40% of injuries
[@SweTrau2022Arsrapport].

Trauma is broadly categorized into two groups by the underlying causal
mechanism: penetrating and blunt trauma. Common examples of penetrating
trauma are bullet wounds and knife cuts. Blunt trauma, however, is
attributed to injuries like road traffic injuries and falls. Generally
speaking, the two types of trauma can also be characterized by the size
of force causing it and the area of impact. Blunt trauma is caused by a
high-force impact over a larger surface area. In contrast, penetrating
trauma results from a force applied to a smaller surface area causing
greater pressure thus acting in a piercing manner and often resulting in
deeper lacerations to tissues and organs. Blunt trauma with enough force
can however be penetrating in character [@hexdall2011Mechanism].

## Impact

The impact of trauma depends greatly on the type of trauma, where it
occurred and to whom it affected.

Trauma contributes for 11.9% of global Years of life lost (YLL)
[@roth2018global]. Furthermore, Trauma is associated with higher
tendency to depression, post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) and
negative effects on cognitive functions etc.
[@north1999psychological];[@muscatelli2017prevalence].

It is calculated that up to 11% of trauma patients have PTSD 3 years
after the traumatic event[@visser2017course]. Furthermore, individuals
who witness traumatic injuries are also subject to higher risk of PTSD.\
Traumatic injuries are associated with 36% not coming back to work
within 1 year [@david2022measuring].

Injuries are, however, not only a burden to the afflicted individual but
also to society as a whole [@newnam2014impacts]. One aspect of such
societal effects are the economic costs. There have been attempts to
estimate the global cost of injury it is a complicated task due to its
variabitity. It is however estimated that the cost of road injuries
alone account for 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in high-income
countries [@world2014injuries].

## Trauma Care Systems

Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and time-critical provision
of healthcare delivered by specialized trauma centres. A myriad of
different specialities are involved in trauma care, including but not
limited to surgeons, orthopaedics, anaesthesiologists, emergency doctors
and nurses. Trauma care is divided into three components: prehospital,
hospital and posthospital. The prehospital component is Trauma centres
have shown significantly less mortality compared to non-trauma centres.
And the level of maturity of a trauma center is also correlated with
reduced mortality which shows the significance of high quality and
specialized care for trauma
[@alharbi2021effectiveness];[@mann1999systematic]. A similar study in
Sweden [@candefjord2020mortality] showed 41% less 30-day mortality in a
mature trauma centre compared to a non-trauma centre. However,\
even with established trauma care systems, due to its complexity and
sensitivity to delay, it is prone to errors
[@nikouline2021errors];[@vioque2014classifying] which in turn can lead
to complications and death. Studies between 1990 and 2014 have shown a
pooled preventable death rate of 20% with newer studies showing less
[@kwon2014pooled]. In a more recent study in A Swedish level I trauma
centre they showed a 4% preventable death rate [@ghorbani2018analysis].

## Quality Improvement

In order to minimize errors in trauma care, Quality improvement (QI)
programs were established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the
International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC)
[@world2009guidelines]. These programs are at the core of current trauma
care systems and its development all around the world.

QI programs consist of a set of recommended techniques that seek to
enable discussion and analysis of the trauma process in order to take
corrective measures for future success. Following techniques are being
used: A multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity conference (MMC), A
preventable death review panel and the use of audit
filters[@world2009guidelines].

### Morbidity and Mortality Conferences and Preventable Death Review Panels

The MMC is a central QI technique. It is an established framework of
crucial components of anonymity, a focus on specific adverse events,
realising flawed approaches, critical analysis and lastly the effort to
change and practice that change [@gregor2016morbidity].

The MMC are regularly scheduled meetings in which specific patient cases
are brought up for discussion. The conference attendees are healthcare
professionals involved in trauma care and its processes, not necessarily
involved in the specific patient case. The patient case selection
process varies but common themes for discussion are unexpected
mortality, unexpected morbidity and errors [@orlander2003morbidity].

It is recommended that they are around 40 minutes but this varies
between different hospitals [@world2009guidelines].

Five themes have been proposed that broadly define QI centred MMC: (1)
clear definition of the role of MMC (2), involving stakeholders, (3)
detecting and selecting appropriate patient cases for presentation, (4)
structuring goal-directed discussion, and (5) forming recommendations
and assigning
follow-up[@giesbrecht2016morbidity];[@churchill2020quality].

When effectively implemented, MMC serve as a crucial fault-examining
tool without being solely negative marks against individual care
providers, instead being incentives for reporting. These conferences
promote a broader, system-based approach that emphasizes the analysis of
tasks, teamwork, and quality improvement[@lazzara2022morbidity]. The
implementation of MMC have been shown to increase reporting of morbidity
and mortality[@kong2016analysis].

Following the MMC there is a preventable death review panel with the
soul purpose of determining whether the death of a patient could have
been preventable [@ghorbani2014clinical].

### Audit filters and Opportunities for improvement

Audit filters also known as quality indicators are specific established
criteria involved in trauma processes and care. It is used to detect
deviation from standardized care in order to further analyse the cause
behind complications in trauma patients. An audit filters can be death
and the placement of 2 large bore intravenous lines within 15 minutes
from arrival to a healthcare facility [@world2009guidelines]. The
purpose of audit filters is to improve quality of care.

Earlier studies showed a reduction in trauma related mortality after the
implementation of audit filters [@chadbunchachai2001comparative].
However, newer studies seem to differ. In 2009 there was an extensive
review made that sought to determine if audit filters could be used in
improving processes of trauma care however none of the studies met
established inclusion criteria [@evans2009audit]. The use of audit
filters have also been associated with high frequencies of false
positives, ranging from 24% to 80%.[@sanddal2011analysis];
[@roy2017learning].

OFIs are the endpoint and aim of MMC. Following the review of individual
patient cases there is a consensus decision made regarding the existence
of an OFI. It has been shown that such review process is associated with
high-quality trauma care [@santana2014development]. OFIs are typically
associated with failures in initial care [@vioque2014classifying],
specifically in airway management, fluid resuscitation, haemorrhage
control and chest injury management [@sanddal2011analysis];
[@roy2017learning]; [@o2013opportunities]. Some audit filters seem to
not correlate with OFIs at all [@lewis2017delay]

## Aim

The aim of the study is to determine whether audit filters are good
indicators for predicting OFIs.

# Methods

We conducted a registry-based cohort study which uses data from the
trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska
University hospital in Solna in order to evaluate the performance of
individual audit filters in predicting OFIs.

## Study setting and population

Karolinska University Hospital is classified as a Trauma level I
hospital. Every year around 1500 patients receive treatment at the
hospital. If a patient case results in team activation it is added to
the Karolinska trauma registry. If no team activation occurred but the
patient had ISS\>9 retrospectively it is also included in the registry.
The Karolinska trauma registry reports to the Swedish Trauma registry
(SweTrau). The registry includes data on vital signs, times, injuries,
and interventions as well as patient demographics according to the
European consensus statement, the Utstein template

The Karolinska trauma registry also contains a care quality database
including specific audit filters and OFIs that are determined in MMC
conferences through consensus decision.

This process of determining OFIs unfolds in multiple stages,
characterized by escalating levels of scrutiny. Notably, instances of
mortality are directly referred to the multidisciplinary conference,
where, in addition to assessing OFIs, a determination is made regarding
whether the death was preventable or potentially preventable, a
classification also falling under the purview of OFIs.

From 2013 to 2017 there was an effort put forward in identifying adverse
outcomes which where unrelated to mortality, the review process
underwent subsequent refinement and formalization during the study
period. During the initial period each trauma patient case underwent
individual assessments by a specialized trauma nurse in order to
identify potential OFIs. It was, however not until 2017 in which this
procedure was formalized and it became standardized to incorporate a
preliminary individual evaluation by a specialized trauma nurse upon
data registration in the trauma registry and the trauma quality
database. The trauma quality data underwent screening of audit filters.
All cases falling within the criteria delineated by these filters, along
with those trauma patients flagged by the nurse during the initial
review for possible care failures, were subjected to a secondary review
by two specialized nurses. Subsequent identification of a potential OFI
during this second review prompted a comprehensive evaluation of the
respective trauma patient's case.

## Participants

In this study, we included all who underwent screening for OFIs.
Exclusion criteria were applied to individuals under the age of 15, as
their clinical management process has notable distinctions compared to
those applicable to the adult population.

## Variables

### Outcome

The outcome variable in this study is an OFI, as established by the MMC
conference through unanimous decision and furthermore valued as a binary
variable with "Yes - At least one OFI identified" and "No - No OFI
identified".

### Exposures

The exposure variable is the audit filters. The following audit filters
are of interest:

• Systolic blood pressure less than 90

• Glasgow coma scale less than 9 and not intubated

• Injury severity score greater than 15 but not admitted to the
intensive care unit

• Time to acute intervention more than 60 minutes from arrival to
hospital

• Time to computed tomography more than 30 minutes from arrival to
hospital

• No anticoagulant therapy within 72 hours after traumatic brain injury

• The presence of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation with thoracotomy

• The presence of a liver or spleen injury

• Massive transfusion, defined as 10 or more units of packed red blood
cells within 24 hours.

## Data sources/measurement

The data will be retrieved from the trauma registry and the trauma care
quality database during the period spanning from 2012 to 2022.

## Bias

Selection bias since the outcome of this study has already occurred.\
There is a possibility that concensus decisions from the MMC conferences
are flawed which causes misclassification bias.

## Study size

The study cohort encompasses all eligible patients treated at the
hospital from 2012 to 2022. There were only two patient cases from 2012.

## Statistical methods

The study results are generated by statistical analytics methods with
the help of the statistical programming language, R. [@R2022language]

To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each individual audit
filter in predicting an OFI a mathematical equation is used:

The sensitivity is calculated accordingly: True positives / (true
positives + false negatives)

The specificity is calculated accordingly: True negatives / (true
negatives + false positives)

This project will link the two databases and assess the performance of
each audit filter in terms of discrimination and accuracy. Logistic
regression and a 5% significance level and 95% confidence level will be
used.
