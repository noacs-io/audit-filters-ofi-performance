[@willis2008interpreting]: Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale <9 who are not intubated. Flagged vs not flagged showed no difference significant diference in mortality. The investigated QIs generally demonstrated poor construct validity and limited usefulness in predicting outcomes

IMPACT: in 2017. 11,9% of global YLL. 8% of global death (27,7% from road traffic injuries)


[@chadbunchachai2001comparative] made use of 32 audit filters in order
to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mortality and preventable
deaths. The use of audit filters showed decreases in mortality (2.6% vs.
2.4%) and preventable death (3.0% vs. 2.0%).

[@teixeira2007preventable] Analysed the deaths of all trauma patients
during a period of 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) at two mature
Trauma Level I centers, The Los Angeles County (LAC) and The University
of Southern California (USC). Weekly Morbidity and mortality (M&M)
conferences followed by multidisciplinary conferences were then held in
order to examine the cause of death by categorizing them into
preventable, potentially preventable, and non-preventable. They found
that 2,5% of deaths were classified as either preventable (0,53%) or
potentially preventable (1,92%).

[@orlander2003morbidity] MMC: frequency is often monthly. Unexpected mortality, morbidity and error are case selections.

[@Ghorbani2018Analysis]
at Karolinska University Hospital, also a trauma level-I center was made
where a Multidisciplinary peer review committee (MPRC) reviewed the
deaths of trauma patients within 30 days of admission during a period of
4 years (April 2012 to March 2016). They came to the conclusion that
(0.4%) of deaths were classified as preventable and (3.6%) were
classified as potentially preventable.

[@kwon2014pooled]
PDRs were widely distributed from 2.5 to 58.5 %, and sample sizes varied from 13 to 2,081. McDermott et al. [20] compared two datasets having separate study periods of (1997–1998) and (2002–2004), and we considered PDRs associated with each study period separately in data synthesis, marked as McDermott et al.1 and McDermott et al.2 in Fig. 2. Considering all 28 studies, we estimated the pooled PDR by meta-analysis. The estimated pooled PDR was 0.20 with a 95 % confidence interval


The results of our study indicate that patient treatment at an institution that is part of a trauma system was observed to improve patients’ survival rates in the current study.

[@stelfox2010quality]
no consensus in quality indicators

[@alharbi2021effectiveness]
Showed positive results of trauma care systems (centers). Reduced mortality
