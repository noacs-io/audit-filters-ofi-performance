# Introduction

Trauma is defined as a physical injury of external origin together with the body's
associated response. This phenomenon constitutes 9% of global deaths each year [@world2014injuries]. 
It is the leading cause of death for individuals between the ages 10 to 49[@vos2020global];[@roth2018global].

Trauma is broadly  categorized into two groups by the underlying causal mechanism: penetrating and blunt trauma. Common examples of penetrating trauma are bullet wounds and knife cuts. Blunt trauma, however, is
attributed to injuries like road traffic injuries and falls. Generally
speaking, the two types of trauma can also be characterized by the size of force causing it and the area of impact. Blunt trauma is caused by a high-force impact over a larger surface area. In contrast, penetrating trauma results from a force
applied to a smaller surface area causing greater pressure thus acting
in a piercing manner and often resulting in deeper lacerations to tissues
and organs. Blunt trauma with enough force can however be penetrating
in character [@hexdall2011Mechanism]. 

Blunt trauma is more common than penetrating trauma. Incidence of penetrating trauma has been shown to be between 3% and 34% depending on region. Crime-rate and firearms usage are correlated to higher rates of penetrating trauma. [@pfeifer2016mortality]; [@stormann2016epidemiology]. 

Globally, the leading cause of injury are road traffic accidents [@vos2020global];[@roth2018global]
In Sweden, road traffic incidence account for around 40% of injuries and falls account for 40% of injuries [@SweTrau2022Arsrapport].

## Impact
The impact of trauma depends on the type of trauma, where it occurred and to whom it affected. 

Trauma contributes to 

Trauma contributes to 11.9% of global Years of life lost (YLL) [@roth2018global]. Furthermore, trauma is associated with higher tendency to depression, post traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), negative effects on cognitive functions etc. [@north1999psychological];[@muscatelli2017prevalence]. Up to 11% of trauma patients have PTSD 3 years after event[@visser2017course]. Individual who witness traumatic injuries are also subject to higher risk of PTSD.  
Traumatic injuries are associated with 36% not coming back to work within 1 year [@david2022measuring]. 

Injuries are, however, not only a burden to the afflicted individual but also to communities and to society as a whole [@newnam2014impacts]. One aspect of such societal effects are the economic costs. There have been attempts to estimate the
global cost  of injury it is a complicated task due to its variability. It is however estimated that the cost of road injuries alone account for 2%
of   gross   domestic   product   (GDP)   in   high-income   countries
[@world2014injuries]. 

## Trauma Care Systems

Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and time-critical
provision of healthcare delivered by specialized trauma
centres. A myriad of different specialities are involved in trauma care, including but not
limited to surgeons, orthopaedics, anaesthesiologists, emergency doctors and
nurses. 

Trauma centres have shown significantly less mortality compared to non-trauma centres. And the level of maturity of a trauma center is also correlated with reduced mortality which shows the significance of high quality and specialized care for trauma [@alharbi2021effectiveness];[@mann1999systematic]. A similar study in Sweden [@candefjord2020mortality] showed 41% less 30-day mortality in a mature trauma centre compared to a non-trauma centre. However,  
even with established trauma care systems, due to its complexity and sensitivity to delay, it is prone
to errors [@nikouline2021errors];[@vioque2014classifying] which in turn can lead to complications and death.
Studies between 1990 and 2014 have shown a pooled preventable death rate of 20% with newer studies showing less [@kwon2014pooled]. In a more recent study in A Swedish level I trauma centre they showed a 4% preventable death rate [@ghorbani2018analysis].


## Quality Improvement

In order to minimize errors in trauma care, Quality improvement (QI) programs were established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the
International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care
(IATSIC) [@world2009guidelines]. These programs are at the
core of current trauma care systems and its
development all around the world.

QI programs consist of a set of recommended techniques that seek to
enable discussion and analysis of the trauma process in order to take
corrective measures for future success. Following techniques are being used: A multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity conference (MMC), A preventable death review panel and the use of audit filters[@world2009guidelines].  

### Morbidity and Mortality Conferences and Preventable Death Review Panels

The MMC is a central QI technique. It is and established framework of crucial
components of anonymity, a focus on specific adverse events, realising
flawed approaches, critical analysis and lastly the effort to change
and practice that change. [@gregor2016morbidity]

The MMC are regularly scheduled meetings in which specific
patient cases are brought up and discussed between healthcare
professionals from all the different disciplines involved in trauma
care and its processes. It is recommended that they are around 40
minutes but this varies between different
hospitals [@world2009guidelines].

Five themes have been proposed that broadly define QI centred MMC: (1) clear definition of the role of MMC (2), involving stakeholders, (3) detecting and selecting appropriate patient cases for presentation, (4) structuring goal-directed discussion, and (5) forming recommendations and assigning follow-up[@giesbrecht2016morbidity];[@churchill2020quality].

When effectively implemented,
MMC serve as a crucial fault-examining tool without being solely negative marks against individual care
providers, instead being incentives for reporting. These conferences promote a
broader, system-based approach that emphasizes the analysis of tasks,
teamwork, and quality improvement[@lazzara2022morbidity]. The implementation of MMC have been shown to increase reporting of morbidity and mortality[@kong2016analysis].

Following the MMC there is a preventable death review panel with the soul purpose of determining whether the death of a patient could have been preventable [@ghorbani2014clinical]. 



### Audit filters and Opportunities for improvement

Audit filters also known as quality indicators are specific
established criteria involved in trauma processes and care. It is used
to detect deviation from standardized care in order to further analyse
the cause behind complications in trauma patients. An
audit filters can be death and the placement of 2 large bore intravenous
lines within 15 minutes from arrival to a healthcare facility
[@world2009guidelines]. The purpose of audit filters is to improve quality of care. 

Earlier studies showed a reduction in trauma related mortality after the implementation of audit filters
[@chadbunchachai2001comparative]. However, newer studies seem to differ. In 2009 there was an extensive
review made that sought to determine if audit filters could be used in
improving processes of trauma care however none of the studies met
established inclusion criteria [@evans2009audit]. The use of audit filters
have also been associated with high frequencies of false positives,
ranging from 24% to 80%.[@sanddal2011analysis]; [@roy2017learning].

OFIs are the endpoint and aim of MMC. Following the review of individual patient cases there is
a consensus decision made regarding the existence of an OFI. It has
been shown that such review process is associated with high-quality
trauma care [@santana2014development]. OFIs are typically associated with failures in
initial care [@vioque2014classifying], specifically in airway
management, fluid resuscitation, haemorrhage control and chest injury
management [@sanddal2011analysis]; [@roy2017learning];
[@o2013opportunities].
 Some audit filters seem to not correlate with
OFIs at all [@lewis2017delay]

## Aim

The aim of the study is to determine whether audit filters are good indicators for predicting OFIs.

# Methods

We conducted a registry-based cohort study which uses data from the trauma
registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University
hospital in Solna in order to evaluate the performance of individual
audit filters in predicting OFIs.

## Study setting and population

Karolinska University Hospital is classified as a Trauma level I
hospital. Every year around 1500 patients receive treatment at the
hospital. If a patient case results in team activation it is added to
the Karolinska trauma registry. If no team activation occurred but the
patient had ISS\>9 retrospectively it is also included in the registry.
The Karolinska trauma registry reports to the
Swedish Trauma registry (SweTrau). The registry includes data on vital
signs, times, injuries, and interventions as well as patient
demographics according to the European consensus statement, the Utstein
template

The Karolinska trauma registry also contains a care quality database including specific audit filters and OFIs that are determined in MMC
conferences through consensus decision.

This process of determining OFIs unfolds in multiple stages,
characterized by escalating levels of scrutiny. Notably, instances of
mortality are directly referred to the multidisciplinary conference,
where, in addition to assessing OFIs, a determination is made regarding
whether the death was preventable or potentially preventable, a
classification also falling under the purview of OFIs. 

From 2013 to 2017 there was an effort put forward in identifying adverse
outcomes which where unrelated to mortality, the review process
underwent subsequent refinement and formalization during the study
period. During the initial period each trauma patient case underwent individual
assessments by a specialized trauma nurse in order to identify potential
OFIs. It was, however not until 2017 in which this procedure was
formalized and it became standardized to incorporate a preliminary
individual evaluation by a specialized trauma nurse upon data
registration in the trauma registry and the trauma quality database. The
trauma quality data underwent screening of audit filters. All cases
falling within the criteria delineated by these filters, along with
those trauma patients flagged by the nurse during the initial review for
possible care failures, were subjected to a secondary review by two
specialized nurses. Subsequent identification of a potential OFI during
this second review prompted a comprehensive evaluation of the respective
trauma patient's case.


## Participants

In this study, we included all who underwent screening for OFIs. Exclusion criteria were
applied to individuals under the age of 15, as their clinical management
process has notable distinctions compared to those applicable to the
adult population.

## Variables

### Outcome

The outcome variable in this study is an OFI, as established by the MMC
conference through unanimous decision and furthermore valued as a binary
variable with "Yes - At least one OFI identified" and "No - No OFI
identified".

### Exposures

The exposure variable is the audit filters. The following audit filters are of interest:

 • Systolic blood pressure less than 90

 • Glasgow coma scale less than 9 and not intubated

 • Injury severity score greater than 15 but not admitted to the intensive care unit

 • Time to acute intervention more than 60 minutes from arrival to hospital

 • Time to computed tomography more than 30 minutes from arrival to hospital

 • No anticoagulant therapy within 72 hours after traumatic brain injury

 • The presence of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation with thoracotomy

 • The presence of a liver or spleen injury

 • Massive transfusion, defined as 10 or more units of packed red blood cells within 24 hours.

## Data sources/measurement

The data will be retrieved from the trauma registry and the trauma care quality database 
during the period spanning from 2012 to 2022.

## Bias
Selection bias since the outcome of this study has already occurred.  
There is a possibility that concensus decisions from the MMC conferences are flawed which causes misclassification bias.

## Study size

The study cohort encompasses all eligible patients treated at the hospital from 2012 to 2022. There were only two patient cases from 2012.

## Statistical methods

The study results are generated by statistical analytics methods with the help of the statistical programming language, R. [@R2022language]

To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each individual audit filter in predicting an OFI a mathematical equation is used:

The sensitivity is calculated accordingly: True positives / (true positives + false negatives) 

The specificity is calculated accordingly: True negatives / (true negatives + false positives)

This project will link the two
databases and assess the performance of each audit filter in terms of discrimination and accuracy. Logistic regression and a 5% significance level and 95% confidence
level will be used.
